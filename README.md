## Umbrella Checker Web Application (PHP and JS)

I built this back in 2011 as part of the interview process for Logitech (hence it's not a very handsome page). It takes in a zipcode, checks the weather in that area, and responds with the weather conditions and whether or not you will need an umbrella there today. Originally it was built with a Google API that has since disappeared, so I've updated it to use Weather Underground instead.

I apologize in advance for the cruddy design/images. I swear it held up better 5 years ago. :P
